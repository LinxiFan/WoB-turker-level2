# Instruction

Please think of a question whose answer will require some kind of web interaction. For example, one needs to do some searching and click a few buttons to find the best dining place on yelp.com. The answer should be visible on the webpage, i.e. it does not require complex reading comprehension or inference. 

Please provide the website and write the question as a template with meaningful blanks. It can be any appropriate website or website subdomain as long as the question template is flexible enough. Be creative! 

# Walk-through

First, enter the URL of the website, e.g. [http://yelp.com](http://yelp.com)

Second, write down the question template with blanks. Please use parentheses "( )" to denote a blank. The words you write inside the parentheses should describe the meaning of the blank. Your question template should have at least **two** blanks. The more blanks the better! 

For instance, enter your question template as 

```
What is the best dining place that serves (type of food) near (geographic location)?
```

A table will be dynamically generated with column titles "type of food" and "geographic location" as you type out the template.

Please fill out the table to complete the question. A live preview will be displayed below the table as you type. You should go to the website and verify that the completed questions _do_ have an answer on that website. However, you donâ€™t need to actually provide an answer.

For example, fill out the table as

| **type of food**  	| **geographic location**                  	|
|---------------	|--------------------------------------	|
| Chinese food  	| Manhattan, NY                        	|
| ice cream     	| Palo Alto                            	|
| barbeque      	| Atlanta                              	|
| seafood       	| Notre Dame De Paris                  	|
| noodles       	| Harvard University                   	|
| tacos         	| Disney World, Orlando, Fl            	|
| hamburger     	| CA 94305                             	|
| McDonald's    	| Times Square                         	|
| Panda Express 	| 200 North Spring Street, Los Angeles 	|
| coffee        	| downtown Seattle                     	|

Please carefully verify the completed questions before you click **submit**. Upon submission, you will receive a confirmation code, which you should copy and paste back to the Mechanical Turk page.

## Bad example
Website: wikipedia.org

Question template:
```
Who is the (N-th) president of (country)?
```

This is a bad template because the answer requires too much reading comprehension. In general, a page with very dense informative text, such as wikipedia.org, is not a good website for question templates.
